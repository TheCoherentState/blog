## Weekly Retrospectives

My thoughts each week.

### Week 1

This week was good. By which standards, I'm not sure, as I am just starting to do these retrospectives, and I have no other weeks against which to compare 
this past one. I talked to many people this past week, among them Juan Miguel (who I met in person for the first time in at least 2 years, if not longer), 
some interesting people from my math/physics classes, and my parents/sisters, who I spent part of Saturday and part of Sunday with.

In terms of productive work, this week was nothing out of the ordinary. I submitted 3 problem sets for QM, analysis, and classical mechanics. 
I finished the problem set and the practice midterm for my topology course. I'm nervous about this midterm. I have not yet attained a level 
of stoicism where I can not freak out about academic assesments, but I'm working on it. A large reaosn why it's so difficult is because my personality and 
my academic success/overall skill at technical subjects are very much coupled, and once I fail at something academic, I feel like I'm losing a part of myself. 
This is obviously not true (at least I hope it's not, or I am a very boring, miserable person!), but unfortunately, the irrational part of my brain doesn't 
care. Whatever, I'll get over it. Rationality will eventually prevail.
